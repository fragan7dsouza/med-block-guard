# 🛡️ **Med-Block-Guard: Clinical Trial Integrity System**

An advanced machine learning and blockchain-integrated system designed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of academic and clinical research texts. This project serves as a security layer to classify data as **Human-written** or **AI-generated** before anchoring it to an immutable ledger.

**Developed as part of a Blockchain Development Internship at Thaniya Technologies.**

---

## 🔥 **Project Overview**

This project utilizes a **Logistic Regression** model trained on a massive dataset (~500k rows) to identify linguistic patterns, word frequencies, and structural nuances. Once a text is analyzed for authenticity, its cryptographic fingerprint (**SHA-256**) is secured within a local blockchain-simulated ledger.

### **Key Features**

* **Real-time ML Analysis:** Instant classification of academic text using a trained Scikit-Learn backend.
* **Probabilistic Results:** Provides a confidence percentage for every human vs. AI verdict.
* **Blockchain Integrity:** Secured by a FastAPI middleware that monitors data tampering via SHA-256 hashing.
* **Minimalist Dashboard:** A clean, high-contrast UI (Teal/White/Grey) for monitoring system-wide data integrity.
* **Privacy-Focused:** Fully local processing with no clinical data leaving the local server.

## 🚀 **Tech Stack**

### **Backend & ML**

* **Python 3.12**: Core logic, data processing, and model execution.
* **FastAPI**: High-performance REST API for model serving and ledger management.
* **Scikit-Learn**: Implementation of Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorization.
* **Joblib**: Model serialization for rapid loading and prediction.

### **Frontend & Dashboard**

* **Vanilla HTML5**: Structure for the security monitoring dashboard.
* **Minimalist CSS3**: Custom teal, grey, and white styling without external frameworks.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: Real-time data fetching and dynamic UI updates via the Fetch API.

## 🧠 **ML Implementation**

The model utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorization** with an `ngram_range` of (1, 2) to capture both individual words and common phrasing patterns.

**Training the Model:**

```bash
cd ml-engine
python train_model.py

```

The system performs class balancing to ensure the detector provides an unbiased result for academic research verification.
